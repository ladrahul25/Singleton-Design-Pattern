# Singleton-Design-Pattern
This class provides singleton class implementation which provides single instance of class.

Features of this class :-
1. Single instance class
2. Globally accessible object reference
3. Thread safe
4. Reflection safe

Requirements :-
1. Private constructor.
2. A static reference of its class.
3. Single entry point static method.
4. Thread safety measurement.
5. Reflection safety measurements.

Note: I have purposely shown singleton example in java language, because in kotlin creating a singleton class is very easy.
